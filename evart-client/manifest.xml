  <description brief="EVaRT client">

    EVa Real-Time Software(tm) - EVaRT(tm) - provides a user with a
    simple and powerful interface to the Motion Analysis(tm) motion
    capture hardware. Under a single software environment you can set
    up, calibrate, capture motion in real-time, capture motion for
    post processing, edit and save data in the format of your choice.

    The evart-stream package contains a network server that connects
    to the EVaRT(tm) motion capture software through the official
    SDK. It then listen to the network for data streaming requests.

    evart-client (this package) is a library with a programming
    interface that can control the evart-stream server. It also
    contains a very basic debugging client that can understand simple
    commands from the standard input and send them to the server.
